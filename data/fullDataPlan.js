        title: `1.Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme`,
        desc: `<p>&esmp;This Government has introduced the flagship programme called Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme from 2011-12 onwards to overcome the bottlenecks in the uneven distribution of resources and to provide minimum basic infrastructure facilities to all the habitations. Tamil Nadu is the only State focusing on ‘Habitation’ as the unit of development and no other State in the Country is implementing such an innovative scheme.</p>
            <p>&esmp;There are about 6 habitations on an average for each Village Panchayat in Tamil Nadu with 79,394 habitations in 12,524 Village Panchayats. However, the number of habitations varies from District to district. The average number of habitations in a Village Panchayat in The Nilgiris District is 37 whereas it is only 3 in Villupuram District. Therefore, allocation of equal amount to all the Village Panchayats, with varied number of habitations, has led to disparity in development, disproportionate distribution of assets and uneven progress. The THAI scheme has come as boon with the aim of extending the basic facilities to the grass root habitation.</p>
        
            <p>&esmp;There are 12,524 Village Panchayats in the State spread across the 31 Districts (except Chennai). As can be seen from the following table, the population of Village Panchayats in Tamil Nadu varies widely with some Village Panchayats having population even below 500 while some others have population exceeding 10,000.</p>
            
           <h3> Minimum Basic Requirements</h3>
            <ol>
            <li> Water Supply</br>&esmp;Drinking water supply works like provision of power pump, extension of pipeline, augmentation of existing source shall be taken up depending upon the requirement.</li>
            <li> Street Lights</br>&esmp;New streetlights will be provided in the new habitations, extension areas, Adi-Dravidar & Tribal habitations and IAY housing colonies, based on the actual needs. Additional street lights, including solar powered lights will be provided in the areas where the existing coverage is felt inadequate.</li>
            <li> Cement Concrete Roads</br>&esmp;Pavements with residential units on sides, streets or lanes prone to water logging, part of the uncovered portion where a portion of the street has already been covered with cement concrete, will be taken up on priority.</li>
            <li> Link Roads</br>&esmp;Link roads will cover bus-plying roads, upgradation of WBM roads to BT roads connecting two or more habitations in the same Panchayat and upgradation of earthen/gravel roads.</li>
            <li> Cremation / Burial Grounds</br>&esmp; Each burial ground / cremation ground will be provided with approach road, compound wall, cremation shed, water facility and lights.</li>

        <p>&esmp;Construction of houses under “Chief Minister’s Solar Powered Green House Scheme” ordered by the Honourable Chief Minister is another milestone in the history of rural housing which clearly addresses the  shelter needs in rural areas. Nowhere in the country is such a free housing scheme for the construction of houses with an area of 300 sq.ft with solar powered lighting implemented.</p>

No land acquisition is envisaged under this scheme.  Only people with patta for their sites are eligible under this scheme.</li>
            <li>The supply, installation and commissioning of solar panels and lights are undertaken directly by TEDA by following established procedures in      co-ordination with the Project Directors of District Rural Development Agencies.</li>

Absence of sanitary facilities is primarily due to both poverty and cultural inhibitions, which had to be overcome.  Therefore, it was of paramount importance to ensure privacy and safety to women besides improving general hygiene and health to the rural people.</p>
               <p>&esmp;The Government in 2001 decided to build Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women in all the 12,618 Village Panchayats in the State, at an approximate area of 750 sq.ft. each. The selected sites were easily accessible to the rural women and nearer to the habitations.  Each complex had 14 water closets, 2 bathrooms, 1 pump room with pump set, 1 water tub and stone-paved washing facilities.  Adequate water supply for washing and bathing requirements were also ensured.  The total users were identified and grouped for the purpose of allocation of individual toilets within the complex.  The Village Panchayats provided electricity connection for water supply and lighting and the allotted families maintained the upkeep of the complex.  The complexes were provided with incinerators for disposal of the sanitary napkins of the user women.</p>
               <p>&esmp;Initially, 385 Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were constructed at the rate of 1 per Panchayat Union at a cost of</p>
               <p>&esmp;Rs.2.00 lakh each.  Between 2001 and 2004, all the Village Panchayats in the State were covered under the Scheme with the enhanced unit cost of Rs. 2.25 lakh.  However, most of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were rendered unusable since the previous Government did not give adequate attention for its maintenance.</p>
               <p>&esmp;As per the directions of the Hon’ble Chief Minister, 12,796 sanitary complexes which were in the state of disuse have been renovated at a cost of Rs.170 crore during 2011-12, thereby restoring the basic facilities of the rural women.</p>`,

                <p>&esmp;The Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women have created a revolution in the sanitation front across the State. Similar to the facilities created for the rural women folk and based on the demand  raised by rural men for such facilities, the Hon’ble  Chief Minister has ordered the provision of  Integrated Men Sanitary  Complexes (IMSC), initially,  at the rate of two Complexes per Block during 2012-13.  In Tamil Nadu, 770 Integrated Men Sanitary Complexes have been taken up for construction in 385 Blocks at a cost of Rs.35 crore during 2012-13.</p>
        
                <p>&esmp;The District Collectors have identified the sites for construction of IMSCs taking into account the various parameters and local requirements like  prevalence of open defecation, predominance  of houses without toilets, availability of water supply, etc.  The total area of the Complex is 570 sq.ft.  Each complex has 8 toilets in which one toilet is provided with western closet for the benefit of the aged/differently abled and one is a baby friendly toilet.  Separate area for bathing, water tub and stone-paved washing facilities are also provided. Exclusive water supply is ensured in each Complex for sustainability and usage.  User Groups are formed and are involved from the construction stage itself. Similar to the maintenance of Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women, these User Groups will take up the day to day maintenance and periodical maintenance will be done by the Village Panchayats concerned.   Corporate bodies and NGOs will also be encouraged to take part in the maintenance of these complexes along with the User Groups.</p>`,
